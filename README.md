Assignment 6:-
1. Write a Python function called is palindrome that takes a string s as input and returns True if s 
is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), otherwise returns False.
2. Write a Python function called calculator that takes three arguments: num1 (float), num2 (float), 
and operation (string). The function should perform the specified operation ('add', 'subtract', 
'multiply', 'divide') on num1 and num2 and return the result
3. Write a python function called word Counter that takes a string “S” as an input, and return the 
count of each character in word or in “S”.
e.g pass S = “upflairs pvt ltd”
u -> 1
p -> 2
l -> 2
and so on .
4. Write a Python function called right_triangle_pattern that takes an integer n as input and prints 
a right triangle pattern of n rows. Each row should contain i asterisks (*), where i is the row 
number.
Example: For n = 5, the pattern should be:
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
5. Write a Python function called multiplication_table that takes an integer n as 
input and prints the multiplication table of n up to 10.
